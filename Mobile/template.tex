\title[Unity Mobile Games]{Performance improvement in Unity mobile games}
\affiliation{Dan-Andrei Iorga}{1154111}{Global Software Development}{Hochschule Fulda}
\begin{abstract}
Game engines such as Unity are convenient ways to center the development process on the game behaviour itself rather than hardware-level implementations. While they are powerful tools that can increase the productivity of the developers, this comes at the cost of efficiency. Ways must be devised to mitigate the performance loss of a premade engine to acceptable results.
