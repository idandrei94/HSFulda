Test cases

1. Input test
Making sure that data is correctly output after input
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4
Result/Output:		tempTagAusgabe will print out 4.0

2. Average test
Making sure that data is correctly processed
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 2 (irrelevant)
Result/Output:		mittelwert will print out 4.0

3. tempTagAusgabe invalid index test
Making sure that tempTagAusgabe correctly handles an out of bound input
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 9
Result/Output:		tempTagAusgabe will throw an error (program won't continue normal flow of execution)

4. tempTagAusgabe invalid index test 2
Making sure that tempTagAusgabe correctly handles wrong input type
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input "three"
Result/Output:		tempTagAusgabe will throw an error (program won't continue normal flow of execution

5. Invalid input test (first value)
Making sure that the program won't continue when first input is invalid
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers ["one",2,3,4,5,6,7]
Result/Output:		tempErfassen will throw an error (program won't continue normal flow of execution)

6. Invalid input test (last value)
Making sure that the program won't continue when last input is invald
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,"seven"]
Result/Output:		tempErfassen will throw an error (program won't continue normal flow of execution)

7. Invalid input test (non margin value)
Making sure that the program won't continue when last input is invalid
Inputs:				tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,"four",5,6,7]
Result/Output:		tempErfassen will throw an error (program won't continue normal flow of execution)

8. Consistency test
Making sure the program always provides the same output for the same input (5 times)
Input:				Running Test case 1 and 2
Output:				Running Test case 1 and 2

9. Irrelevant change test
On multiple runs with slightly different input, the common input should yield the same result
Run1:
	Input:	tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4
	Output:	tempTagAusgabe will print out 4.0
Run2:
	Input:	tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4
	Output:	tempTagAusgabe will print out 4.0

10.	Consistent average test
mittelwert should print the same output for any permutation of a set tempErfassen input
Run1:
	Input: 	tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4 (irrelevant)
	Output:	mittelwert will print out 4.0
Run2:
	Input: 	tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [1,7,3,4,5,6,2], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4 (irrelevant)
	Output:	mittelwert will print out 4.0
Run3:
	Input: 	tempErfassen will receive the following numbers [6,4,7,1,5,2,3], tempTagAusgabe will receive input 4 (irrelevant)
	Output:	mittelwert will print out 4.0
