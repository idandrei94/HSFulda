The scale of the performance topic in computer applications is extremely broad, and beyond the scope of this article. In this chapter, we will focus specifically on Space Shooter, and on certain techniques for improving it, along with measuring the gains that come with their implementations. These implementations will be progressive as opposed to being implemented separately, on the same base application. This decision was made in order to better reflect a real process of optimizing a game.
