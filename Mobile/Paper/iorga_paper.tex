\begin{abstract}
Game engines such as Unity are convenient ways to center the development process on the game behaviour itself rather than hardware-level implementations. While they are powerful tools that can increase the productivity of the developers, this comes at the cost of efficiency. Ways must be devised to mitigate the performance loss of a premade engine to acceptable results. This paper will present the study of a sample game implemented in Unity and the results of applying various perfromance-improving techniques on it.

\section{Conclusions}
XXX Some example text with cites: 
Frameworks like Apple ARKit \cite{ARKit} and Google ARCore \cite{ARCore} provide an easy use of
computer vision based tracking technologies to build new mobile Augmented Reality applications.
XXX Especially in the automotive industry mobile AR-based training and infotainment apps, like 
the "Mobile Augmented Reality Technical Assistance" project described in \cite{Stanimirovic14}, 
are becoming more and more a selling point. Therefore, XXX
