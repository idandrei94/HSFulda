As previously stated, consistent testing environments are of critical importance to ensure the relevance of the results following a test over successive iterations of an application. Space Shooter is being developed on the Windows PC platform, and is aimed to also run as an Android application. As such, for the demonstrations required by this study, one Motorola Moto E4 was considered a good choice, both because of availability reasons, as well as the fact that its specs are on the lower end of the performance spectrum compared to premium, latest gen devices. This way, every performance gain, however small, will have a strong impact, especially if the initial gameplay experience is undersirable due to performance issues. \\
Since a Windows PC is used to develop the game itself, we decided to include this machine in the performance test, to see the high-end spectrum as well. Performing the same tests on a computer that can already run the application much better than needed may yield interesting results and surprising insights. Both devices capabilities can be found in the previously shown Table 1, under the ``Moto E 4'' and ``Custom-built PC'' entries. \\ 
Both devices will run the latest relevant updates (drivers, operating system updates) during the start of the process, and they will not be further updated in case of future releases for the sake of consistency.
