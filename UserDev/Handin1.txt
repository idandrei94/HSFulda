Task 1-1
a) Things whose purpose is difficult to discern, through their presentation (names, pictures), location etc
	How well does X name describe its purpose?
b) Tiny distractions add up, wasting energy and time from the actual task. It's not a dramatic impact in itself, but if every action throughout a day 
	was full of them, one would go to sleep cranky(er). We want happy users, not frustrated users
c) A product (especially online) should be self-explanatorty
d) "It's hard to go wrong", self evident or at least self explanatorty

Task 1-2 2 examples
Where should I start?
  Too much (unneeded) information becomes confusing, the user has to sift through it for what they want. Imagine everything being on one single page,
    every input, every piece of information. 
Why is it called like that?
  Names and titles, links etc should be self explanatory, or the user will wonder what the right action is.

Can I click on that?
  Links for example should be clearly marked. 
  "Click here to start your download"  - click where?!?! If "here" is a link, it should be obvious and set apart from other text
Is that X? Or is it over there?
Why is that there?
  The less something matches our way of thinking, the less intuitive it is.
Are those 2 the same?

Task 1-3
a) H1, the user is aware that the upload started and is in progress
b) H4 , software from the same suite (office) follow similar interfaces where common aspects are 
    involved / use real-world terms that are suggestive to their purpose
c) H3 The user knows where they are, and can easily access something else if the current choice is proven 'wrong' 
d) H5 - less likely to cancel and lose all progress
